FishLight\_PCB: A custom PCB for the FishLight project.

=========

This is a custom PCB design for the FishLight project.  This started out as a simple board using an Arduino to control the brightness of the LEDs I am using for my fishtank.  However, it has quickly grown into an all around fishtank control system.  It has the ability to turn on and off the LEDs, monitor each string's power usage, adjust the amount of current being supplied to each string, turn on and off a number of 12V and AC devices (such as solenoids, pumps, fans, heaters, filters, etc.), monitor temperature of the board and the fishtank, conduct automatic water changes and top-offs, and connect to the internet using a Spark Core instead of arduino.
